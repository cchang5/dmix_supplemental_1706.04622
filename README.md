# dmix_supplemental_1706.04622
Supplemental data for FNAL/MILC D-mixing asqtad project for publication arxiv: 1706.04622


Three files are included in the supplemental material:
  1. Comma-separated-value (csv) file for values of r1/a used in this project, along with the standard deviation, variance, correlation and covariance matrices.
  2. csv file for matrix elements in units of GeV^4 with corresponding standard deviations, and correlation matrices for both BMU and BBGLN schemes.
  3. Sqlite3 database which includes the D-mixing final correlator fits along with the bootstraps. The first entry is the boot0 fit, followed by the bootstrap list.
  4. Sqlite3 database for the B-mixing final correlator fits used in arXiv:1602.03560. The first entry is the boot0 fit, followed by the bootstrap list.


sqlite3 is a standard database that comes with the installation of Python and may be queried using the SQL syntax.
